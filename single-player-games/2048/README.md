# 2048

Interestingly, you can actually turn 2048 into a two player adversarial game where one player tries to get 2048 (or the highest score possible) by sliding up, down, left, or right, and the other player tries to minimize the final score by placing tiles maliciously.

### Possible Reward Functions
* Maximize number of points earned per slide
* Minimize number of tiles on the board
