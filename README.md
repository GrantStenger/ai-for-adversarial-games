## Background


## Questions to Explore
* How does the strategy change when:
  * We generalize to n dimensions?
  * We generalize to depth d?
  * We generalize to k players?
  * We generalize to c colors?
  * The ratio of cobras changes?
  * The ratio of ankhs changes?
* How how much advantage does player 1 have over player k?
* What changes can we make to ensure a more 'fair' game?
* What heuristics does a hand designed algorithm learn that a reinforcement learning algorithm doesn't, and vice versa.
* What is the complexity of the game?
* When are there 'interesting cases' of k and c (i.e. 3 players and 4 colors)?
  * Possibly all k mod c != 0 are all interesting.
