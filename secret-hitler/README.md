# Secret Hitler

### Introduction [1]
* Secret Hitler is a social deduction game for 5-10 people about finding and stopping the Secret Hitler.
* Players are secretly divided into two teams: the liberals, who have a majority, and the fascists, who are hidden to everyone but each other. If the liberals can learn to trust each other, they have enough votes to control the elections and save the day. But the fascists will say whatever it takes to get elected, advance their agenda, and win the game.

### Background
* Would be very interesting to me if we can build an AI to play this game.
* It seems like so much of the communication happens off the board in human interaction.
* I wonder if the most important information is stored in our actual moves.
