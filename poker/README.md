### Math
* Expected number of 7 card hands to draw a flush?
* Probability of drawing a straight given 7,8?
* Probability of drawing a straight given two consecutive cards?
* Probability of drawing a straight given two consecutive cards given distance from ends (e.g. A2 vs 78)?
* Given two cards of the same suit, how likely are you to get a flush?
* How likely is it to have a straight and a flush but not a straight flush?
* Compute the probability of a full house, 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, flush, straight flush, etc.

### To Do's
* Make it possible to input any hands to decide who wins these hands. Will be useful to test edge cases of winner deciding logic.
* Implement kelly criterion––bankroll management
