This directory contains a C++ implementation of tic-tac-toe that a user can use to play
against another human on the same machine, or against a computer.  The computer decides
upon its moves using a minimax decision tree to decide on the optimal outcome.

To play the game, type "make" to compile the program, then type "./main" to run the
program.  The program will query whether you want to play against the computer or against
another human.
