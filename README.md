# AI in Adversarial Games

### Game Status
* Tic-tac-toe is fully built and plays perfectly. It is unbeatable. It needs to be optimized and code should be cleaner.
* Connect-4 is built and AI development is in progress.
* Pyramix is currently being built.
* Texas Hold'em is currently being rebuilt with better optimization.
* Chess, Black Jack, checkers, dollar-auction, and prisoners dilemma are currently unbuilt.

### Algorithms to test
* Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning
* Deep Q Learning
* Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients
* Monte Carlo Tree Search
